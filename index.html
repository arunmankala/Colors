<h1>Welcome to the world of colors</h1>
<p>The importance of colour in your home d√©cor cannot be emphasized enough. It can alter how you view space by enhancing beauty, creating an illusion, or even hiding plain design. Find out all about colours, trends, and how you can use them to your advantage with our page.<br>
the most common question I hear from clients is:<font color="red"> "What color should I choose?" </font>This is a very good question indeed! After all, it is a decision that they will have to live with for a very long time.<br>

It is generally understood that color combinations which appear pleasing are made up of colors considered to be in harmony or agree with each other. Colors that do not agree with each other or that clash are not in harmony.<br>

Some color will already be established for you by things such as the color of your roof, shrubbery and the color of buildings next door. Your color selection does not need to be wholly determined by those other colors, but it should not clash with them either. The color of your furnishings can guide you in the selection of interior paint colors.</p>
